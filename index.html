                <p>Long ago, two races ruled over Earth: HUMANS and MONSTERS. One day, war broke out between the two races. After a long battle, the humans were victorious. They sealed the monsters underground with a magic barrier.</p>
                <br><p>Many years later... A human child (the player) falls down into the Underground through a hole in Mt. Ebott. This child is you. Undertale is a role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. Released in 2015, it became famous for its unique approach to the RPG genre and its memorable characters.</p>
                <br><p>What makes Undertale special is its moral choice system. Instead of just fighting monsters, you can choose to spare them, talk to them, and even befriend them. Every monster encounter can be resolved peacefully through the ACT menu - you might compliment a creature, tell a joke, or help solve their problems.</p>
                <br><p>Throughout your journey, you'll encounter unforgettable characters like Flowey the flower, Toriel the caring goat mother, Sans the laid-back skeleton, and many others who each have their own stories and personalities. The game's combat system is unique - when monsters attack, you control a small heart and must dodge bullet-hell style attacks in a small box.</p>
                <br><p>Your DETERMINATION allows you to SAVE your progress and continue your journey, no matter what challenges you face. Whether you choose the Pacifist Route (spare every monster), Neutral Route (mix of fighting and sparing), or Genocide Route (kill every monster), your choices will shape not just the story, but the very world around you.</p>
                <br>    <p>Undertale became a cultural phenomenon, praised for its storytelling, music composed by Toby Fox, and emotional depth. Its message about kindness, understanding, and the power of choice resonated with players worldwide, creating a passionate and creative fanbase. Despite everything, it's still you.</p>
